The Tournament is happening here on our Tropical Volcanic Planet we call Budahunga. It is still bare hands only fish catching day, no trapping, or explosive devices, or Ray Guns can be used to catch a fish. You see me arriving in a personal mobility antigravity personal mobility scooter, just as a contestant from the Planet Sawammi, in Dimension six, just walked out of the lake, This fellow is possibly the fastest swimmer in the Cosmos. His name is Svin. It has been said by other contestants, Svin can swim 35 mph, or 30.41 knots, an amazing 51 feet per second. Much faster than any fish in Lake Budahunga. Svin just drug a whopper big mouth golden lake bass up on the shore, the bass still has a surprised look, that Svin could swim so fast, and grab him by his lip, and drag him, or her out of the lake. If anyone is interested, the Gold Bass are the main ingredient in the greatest fish tacos in the Cosmos, served only at the famous Last Fish Taco Shop at the end of the Galaxy. Located next to the Bad Ass Bait And Tackle Shop on the shore of Lake Budahunga. Until next time Tata the Rod Blog.<\/p> ",

Here is Webb\u2019s look at Westerlund 1, one of the closest clusters of its kind. Super star clusters are young and contain more than 10,000 times the mass of the Sun packed into a small volume. Westerlund 1 is the most massive yet identified in our galaxy, with 50,000 to 100,000 times the mass of the Sun contained within a region less than six light-years across. Still considered an open cluster now, someday it will evolve into a globular cluster - a roughly spherical, tightly packed collection of old stars bound together by gravity.<br \/> <br \/> Super star clusters are one of the most extreme environments in which stars and planets can form. Because our galaxy is past its peak of star formation, and because stars live relatively short lives, only a few of these clusters still exist to give us clues to that past era. <br \/> <br \/> Westerlund 1 has a large, dense, and diverse population of evolved, massive stars. It contains so many massive stars that in a timespan of less than 40 million years, it\u2019ll be the site of more than 1500 supernovas. This cluster is a natural laboratory for the study of extreme stellar physics, helping us learn how the most massive stars in our galaxy live and die, and how stellar winds, supernovae, and other ejected material affect star formation within their environment.<br \/> <br \/> Image credit: ESA\/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, M.

Guarcello (INAF-OAPA) and the EWOCS team<br \/> <br \/> Image description: A dense cluster of bright stars, each with six large and two small diffraction spikes, due to the telescope\u2019s optics. They have a variety of sizes depending on their brightness and distance from us in the cluster, and different colors reflecting different types of star. Patches of billowing red gas can be seen in and around the cluster, lit up by the stars. Small stars in the cluster blend into a background of distant stars and galaxies on black.<\/p> ",

Spiral galaxies are young and energetic, filled with the gas needed to form new stars and sporting spiral arms hosting hot, bright stars. Elliptical galaxies have a much more pedestrian look, their light coming from a uniform population of older and redder stars. But other galaxies require in-depth study to understand: such is the case with NGC 4694, a galaxy located 54 million light-years from Earth in the Virgo galaxy cluster, and the subject of this Hubble Picture of the Week.<br \/> <br \/> NGC 4694 has a smooth-looking, armless disc which \u2014 like an elliptical galaxy \u2014 is nearly devoid of star formation. However its stellar population is still relatively young and new stars are still actively forming in its core, powering the brightness we can see in this image and giving it a markedly different stellar profile from that of a classic elliptical galaxy. The galaxy is also suffused by the kinds of gas and dust normally seen in a young and sprightly spiral; elliptical galaxies often do host significant quantities of dust, but not the gas needed to form new stars. NGC 4694 is surrounded by a huge cloud of invisible hydrogen gas, fuel for star formation. This stellar activity is the reason for Hubble\u2019s observations here.<br \/> <br \/> As this Hubble image shows, the dust in this galaxy forms chaotic structures that indicate some kind of disturbance. It turns out that the cloud of hydrogen gas around NGC 4694 forms a long bridge to a nearby, faint dwarf galaxy named VCC 2062. The two galaxies have undergone a violent collision, and the larger NGC 4694 is accreting gas from the smaller galaxy. Based on its peculiar shape and its star-forming activity, NGC 4694 has been classified as a lenticular galaxy: lacking the unmistakable arms of a spiral, but not so bereft of gas as an elliptical galaxy, and still with a galactic bulge and disc. Some galaxies just aren\u2019t so easy to classify as one type or the other!<br \/> <br \/> [Image Description: An oval-shaped galaxy seen tilted at an angle. It glows brightly at its central point, with the radiated light dimming out to the edge of the oval. Reddish-brown, patchy dust spreads out from the core and covers much of the galaxy\u2019s top half, as well as the outer edge, obscuring some of its light. Stars can be seen around and in front of the galaxy.]<br \/> <br \/> <b>Credits:<\/b> ESA\/Hubble &amp; NASA, D.

It was discovered in 1961 from Australia by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund. Westerlund 1 is an incomparable natural laboratory for the study of extreme stellar physics, helping astronomers to find out how the most massive stars in our Galaxy live and die.<br \/> <br \/> The unique draw of Westerlund 1 is its large, dense, and diverse population of massive stars, which has no counterpart in other known Milky Way galaxy clusters in terms of the number of stars and the richness of spectral types and evolutionary phases. All stars identified in this cluster are evolved and very massive, spanning the full range of stellar classifications including Wolf-Rayet stars, OB supergiants, yellow hypergiants (nearly as bright as a million Suns) and luminous blue variables. Because such stars have a rather short life, Westerlund 1 is very young, astronomically speaking. Astronomers estimate the cluster\u2019s age to be somewhere between 3.5 and 5 million years (its exact age is still a matter of debate), making it a newborn cluster in our galaxy. In the future, it is believed that it will likely evolve from an open cluster into a globular cluster. These are roughly spherical, tightly packed collections of old stars bound together by gravity.<br \/> <br \/> Currently, only a handful of stars form in our galaxy each year, but in the past the situation was different. The Milky Way galaxy used to produce many more stars, likely hitting its peak of churning out dozens or hundreds of stars per year about 10 billion years ago and then gradually declining ever since. Astronomers think that most of this star formation took place in massive clusters of stars, known as \u201csuper star clusters\u201d. These are young clusters of stars that contain more than 10,000 times the mass of the Sun, packed into an unbelievably small volume. They represent the most extreme environments in which stars and planets can form. Only a few super star clusters still exist in our galaxy \u2014 of which Westerlund 1 is one \u2014 but they offer important clues about this earlier era when most of our galaxy\u2019s stars formed.<br \/> <br \/> Westerlund 1 is an impressive example of a super star cluster: it contains hundreds of very massive stars, some shining with a brilliance of almost one million Suns and others two thousand times larger than the Sun (as large as the orbit of Saturn). Indeed, if the Solar System was located at the heart of this remarkable cluster, our sky would be full of hundreds of stars as bright as the full Moon. It appears to be the most massive compact young cluster yet identified in the Milky Way galaxy: astronomers believe that this extreme cluster contains between 50 000 and 100 000 times the mass of the Sun, yet all of its stars are located within a region less than six light-years across. Even so, it is the biggest of these remaining super star clusters in the Milky Way galaxy, and the closest super star cluster to Earth. These qualities make Westerlund 1 an excellent target for studying the impact of a super star cluster\u2019s environment on the formation process of stars and planets, as well as the evolution of stars over a broad range of masses.<br \/> <br \/> The huge population of massive stars in Westerlund 1 suggests that it will have a very significant impact on its surroundings. The cluster contains so many massive stars that in a time span of less than 40 million years, it will be the site of more than 1 500 supernovae. This super star cluster now provides astronomers with a unique perspective towards one of the most extreme environments in the Universe. Westerlund 1 will certainly provide new opportunities in the long-standing quest for more and finer details about how stars, and especially massive stars, form.<br \/> <br \/> This image was captured as part of the The Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey (EWOCS) with Webb\u2019s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). This survey is a dedicated Webb program (GO 1905, PI: M. G. Guarcello) that aims to study star and planet formation and stellar evolution in starburst regions in Westerlund 1 and Westerlund 2, two of the closest super star clusters to the Sun.<br \/> <br \/> With its unparalleled performance in the infrared, Webb offers astronomers the opportunity to unveil the population of low-mass stars in local super star clusters for the first time, and to study the environments around these clusters\u2019 most massive stars. Webb observations of the massive stars in super star clusters can shed light on how feedback (stellar winds, supernovae and other ejected material) from these stars impacts their surrounding environments and the overall star formation process within their parental clouds. <br \/> <br \/> [Image Description: A dense cluster of bright stars, each with six large and two small diffraction spikes, due to the telescope\u2019s optics. They have a variety of sizes depending on their brightness and distance from us in the cluster, and different colours reflecting different types of star. Patches of billowing red gas can be seen in and around the cluster, lit up by the stars. Small stars in the cluster blend into a background of distant stars and galaxies on black.]<br \/> <br \/> <b>Credits:<\/b> ESA\/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, M. Zamani (ESA\/Webb), M. G.

This second firing follows from a first firing test of the motor in May 2024 and concludes the qualification tests for the improved engine nozzle design of the Zefiro-40.<br \/> <br \/> Engineers are analysing the motor\u2019s performance, with the initial post-test review indicating that the new nozzle assembly and the motor performed as expected.<br \/> <br \/> Whereas the first test in May was performed under high operating pressure and with a short burning time, today\u2019s test was conducted at a low operating pressure and burnt for longer, as expected and according to the test predictions. The two firings are standard procedure when preparing solid-fuel rocket motors for operations, allowing Vega-C to be launched by the end of 2024.<br \/> <br \/> Zefiro-40 is a 7.6 m tall rocket motor, loaded with over 36 tonnes of solid propellant, and just one of three solid-propulsion stages that are used by Vega-C. For this test the motor was installed on its horizontal test bench. Zefiro-40 is developed and manufactured by Avio in their Colleferro factory near Rome, Italy.<br \/> <br \/> <b>Credits:<\/b> Avio<\/p> ",
